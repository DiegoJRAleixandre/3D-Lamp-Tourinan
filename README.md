# Lamp-Tourinan
 3D printed lamp of the Tourinan cape in Galicia

 Using an Arduino nano with an RGB led, a servo motor and some basic electronic components, I have made this night light.

 It can change its color, as well as rotate to simulate a working lighthouse. It also has some storage inside the "house" part of the light house.

 The "glass" part made out of transparent 3D filament can be replaced by lithophanes.
